    """
    Represents the state of the React-Gated Mixture-of-Agents workflow graph.
    
    This state structure supports long-term memory through conversation summarization,
    preventing prompt size explosion while maintaining context across long conversations.
    The workflow orchestrates a master agent that delegates tasks to sub-agents.

    Attributes:
        messages: The recent messages in the conversation (last N messages before summarization)
        conversation_summary: Accumulated summary of older conversation history
        user_query: The original query submitted by the user
        final_output: The final response from the master agent after orchestration
        next_action: The next action to take (tool_call, final_answer, summarize, continue)
        error_message: A message describing an error, if one occurs during execution
        iteration_count: Counter to prevent infinite loops (incremented on each agent node call)
